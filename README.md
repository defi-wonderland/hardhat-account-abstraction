## Environment extensions

This plugin does not extend the hardhat runtime environment

## Configuration

This plugin requires 3 new field inside a `sponsoredTransaction` object which will be nested inside each hardhat network that is set in the config

This is an example of how to set it:

```js
const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  solidity: '0.8.19',
  defaultNetwork: 'goerli',
  networks: {
    goerli: {
      url: process.env.GOERLI_RPC_URL as string,
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as string],
      sponsoredTransactions: {
        bundlerUrl: 'https://example.com', // The bundler that the UserOperations will be sent to
        paymasterUrl: 'https://example.com', // The paymaster API that will be used for sponsoring transactions
        paymasterType: 'pimlico' // The type of paymaster it is
      }
    }
  }
};
```

### Supported Paymaster Types

Currently we support 3 paymaster types which are the following:

1. Pimlico which can be set as `pimlico`
1. Stackup which can be set as `stackup`
1. Base which can be set as `base`


If you would like to add support for a new paymaster check out the guide [here](#adding-a-new-paymaster-to-the-plugin)


## Usage

After you have setup the configuration for the `sponsoredTransactions` and you are using a network that has them enable you are good to go, you can right a simple script below and your transactions will be mined on the testnet that you have configured!

```js
const signer = await ethers.provider.getSigner();
const testToken = new ethers.Contract('0x16F63C5036d3F48A239358656a8f123eCE85789C', TEST_TOKEN_ABI, signer);
const amountToMint = ethers.parseEther('6.9');
await testToken.mint(amountToMint);
```

## Adding a new paymaster to the plugin

TODO when this functionallity is finalized
